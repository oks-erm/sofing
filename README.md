# SOFING Responsive Website
![Website Mock Up](assets/images/mockup.png)
# Purpose
This project is a static website aimed at popularizing a new sporting activity called [Sofing](https://oks-erm.github.io/sofing/index.html), which involves you and your couch. It hopes to give a chance to belong to everyone who wants to be a part of a community and have a trendy hobby with little commitment. 

The core purposes of the website:
- introduce Sofing to a broad audience, spread **"philosofy"**.
- advertise related projects.
- create a community and help people connect via networking and local practices. 
- make visitors smile. 

The website is built using HTML and CSS as a Milestone Project#1 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.  

[The live website is available here](https://oks-erm.github.io/sofing/index.html)

### Meetups 
It was decided to take this section to the separate web-site (supposedly existing), because it is intended as a commercial project and contains plenty of information, which deserves a separate platform. However it was considered reasonable including it in the menu to inform about it, because the movement in new and users can not assume what features it includes. So it takes the user to the website of **Sofing Bootcamp** where the user may obtain all the relevant information about training. 

## Design

As Sofing is a completely new thing, the design shapes future brand recognition. The project's design springs from the ethos and values of Sofing: it's cheerful, bold and calm at the same time. It seems to be contrasting purposes, but it's a conscious intention to make it a little contradictory for comical effect, as a part of mocking existing cliches. It’s somewhat a combination of a stereotypical small business, sports and a furniture store website, as I see it. 

### Colour Scheme

A seemingly unconventional colour palette choice serves to embody a maverick component, mock existing cliches and challenge the rules (such as colour combination), just as Sofing does by turning doing nothing into a sport. 

Shades of Whitesmoke: #efefef, #f8f8f8 (Background colour, Text colour on dark background) - represent calm, air and light; two shades are used for volume effect.  
Dark charcoal: #333333 (Main Text Colour, Background Colour for one block on the home page) -
Charcoal Gray: #6a6a6a (Headings, when Dark Charcoal made them too heavy, and borders) -
C - cheerful, friendly and bold, 
blue - trust and .

In fact, [57% of men and 35% of women say it’s their favorite color](https://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/24214633/website-color-palettes-35.png), it’s the most common “favorite” color among the majority of the population. So, if you want to appeal to a wide audience, this could be a great choice for your site.
