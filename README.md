# SOFING

# Purpose
This project is a static website aimed at popularizing a new sporting activity, which involves you and your couch, called [Sofing](https://oks-erm.github.io/sofing/index.html) (unfortunately imaginary). Sofing promotes mental balance, combats stress and makes you feel good about yourself. It hopes to create a community brought together by positivity and chill. It finally gives a chance to belong to everyone who wants to be a part of a community and have a trendy hobby, but there have always been reasons not to. 

The core purpose of the website is to introduce Sofing to a broad audience, spread **"philosofy"** and help people connect via networking and local practices, which they can find here. Apart from that it is important for the client to make visitors smile.

The website is built using HTML and CSS as a Milestone Project#1 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.  

[The live website is available here](https://oks-erm.github.io/sofing/index.html)
